# Jeypeer
Jeypeer is a minimalist blockchain implementation with advanced cryptography and a simple P2P system for creating and sharing blocks. The project combines modern hashing with a lean C architecture, allowing for the exploration of blockchain concepts, event tokenization, and peer-to-peer communication in a direct and transparent way.
